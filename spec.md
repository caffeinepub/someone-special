# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix unreadable note/NoteCard popup text at the bottom of the site by improving text contrast and background visibility.

**Planned changes:**
- Ensure NoteCard popup text (message, creator name, date) has sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 ratio) against the card background
- Apply a solid or sufficiently opaque background fill to NoteCard so decorative elements do not bleed through and reduce legibility
- Override text colors as needed so romantic styling does not obscure readability
- Apply the fix consistently for all heart note positions (top, middle, bottom of canvas)

**User-visible outcome:** Note messages displayed on the canvas are clearly readable in all positions, with legible text and sufficient background contrast regardless of where they appear on the page.
