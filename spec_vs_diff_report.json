  "summary": "All three requirements are implemented. REQ-2 is satisfied by the new updatePosition function in backend/main.mo. REQ-3 is satisfied by the useUpdateHeartPosition hook in useQueries.ts. REQ-1 is satisfied by the drag-and-drop logic in HeartCanvas.tsx. The implementation is consistent with the acceptance criteria, including percentage-based positioning, click-vs-drag disambiguation, backend persistence, and query invalidation. The backend updatePosition uses Runtime.trap for invalid IDs which satisfies the requirement for an appropriate error response. No hallucinated features were detected.",
