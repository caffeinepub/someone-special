  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for both REQ-1 and REQ-2. For REQ-1, the frontend useQueries hook was updated with retry logic, staleTime:0, refetchOnMount/WindowFocus, and App.tsx now handles error states with a retry button. For REQ-2, a migration module was added to preserve stable state across upgrades, and the backend CRUD functions appear intact. All core acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
