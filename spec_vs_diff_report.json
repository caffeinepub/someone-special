  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for NoteCard text readability and contrast issues as required by REQ-8. NoteCard.tsx now uses a fully opaque solid background (#fff7f5), explicit dark text colors for message (#2d1a1a), creator (#9b3a5a), and date (#7a3a4a). HeartCanvas.tsx adds logic to detect hearts in the lower portion of the canvas and passes openUpward={true} to NoteCard, preventing overflow and ensuring the card does not land on dark backgrounds. All four acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
